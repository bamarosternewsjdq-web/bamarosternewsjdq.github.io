I graduated from the University of Alabama in 2019. My grandfather was the captain of the Million Dollar Band in the 1940's so growing up, my mom always had Alabama football on the TV. As a student I quickly became obsessed with Alabama sports. I started sending a newsletter out in 2024 via email and created this website to archive each newsletter.
