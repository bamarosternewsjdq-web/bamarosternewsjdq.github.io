## Hello and Roll Tide! 

On December 31st, 2024 Alabama will play the Michigan Wolverines in the ReliaQuest Bowl. The Tide are familiar with Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida as they traveled there last season to play the USF Bulls. If Alabama wins, Kalen DeBoer would finish the season with 10 wins, which would be the record for most wins by an Alabama head coach in their first season. Below I will review incoming and outgoing transfers, preview the Michigan Wolverines, and discuss Bowl Game storylines. Let’s go!

## ReliaQuest Bowl: Michigan Wolverines:

For the second year in a row, Alabama and Michigan face off in the Postseason. Last season was a battle of Goliaths as the Tide and Wolverines met in the College Football Playoffs. This time around, both teams underperformed and are looking for a final win to start the off-season on a high note.

Michigan comes into the bowl game with a record of 7-5 (5-4) after a stunning win over Ohio State in The Big Game. Michigan has beaten Ohio State 4 years in a row, flipping the script on this rivalry. Head Coach Sherrone Moore is in his first season as the Michigan Head Coach and winning their biggest rivalry game was a great start. Outside of that, the season has been incredibly rocky for the Wolverines. Michigan ranks 112th in the country in offensive points per game (22.3) and 22nd in defensive points allowed per game (20.5). While the defense was a strength, Michigan struggled mightily throwing the football. Averaging 133.6 passing yards per game, Michigan is the 5th worst passing offense in the FBS. They were still below average rushing the ball, averaging 160.7 yards per game, ranked 72nd in the nation. Their offensive struggles mixed with a good defense led to many 1-score contests. Michigan was 4-1 in one score games. The defense seems to step it up when they need it the most.

Michigan’s offense is led by running back Kalel Mullings who ran for 948 yards and 12 touchdowns. The Quarterback position rotated all year due to poor play and injury. Davis Warren was the starter to open the season but was replaced by Alex Orji in week 4. Orji started the next two weeks before Moore and staff decided to give Jack Tuttle a try. Tuttle played against Washington and Illinois before retiring from Football on October 29th, citing his 5th concussion. This roller coaster of a season at the position group led boosters at the University of Michigan to put together an NIL deal worth over $10 million to flip #1 QB prospect Bryce Underwood from LSU.

Michigan’s defense is littered with NFL draft prospects, 3 receiving a 1st round grade with another expected to go in the 2nd round. Three of these players are on their defensive line: Masan Graham, Kenneth Grant, and Josaiah Stewart. All 3 of them are top 4 on their team in sacks, notably Josaiah Stewart has 8.5. Cornerback Will Johnson is expected to go in the first round of the NFL draft as he leads the team in interceptions and defensive touchdowns this season. Michigan has an elite defense that kept them in games all season long. That being said, most starting players on Michigan opted out of the game.

 
## Bowl Game Storylines:

·        **Who’s playing Wide Receiver?:** Alabama saw 4 wide receivers hit the portal leading up to the bowl game. Bama is also full of injuries at the position as Jalen Hale, Cole Adams, Amari Jefferson, and Bubba Hampton are not healthy. This leaves only 4 Wide receivers available to play against Michigan: Ryan Williams, Germie Bernard, Jaren Hamilton, and Rico Scott. Luckily Bama’s top two receiving options are available, Ryan and Germie. Rico Scott caught 4 passes for 51 yards and 1 touchdown this season. Jaren Hamilton did not make any receptions during the season. The bowl game will provide a great opportunity for these two to get some real-time reps. As well, Jaylen Mbakwe has been practicing with the offense leading up to the bowl game, so we should expect to see him involved.



·        **Farewell Jalen?:** This may be Jalen Milroe’s last game as the quarterback of the Alabama Crimson Tide. Jalen has not announced anything, however it is likely that he will enter the NFL draft. Milroe is the All-time leader in rushing touchdowns by Alabama quarterbacks. He is second in rushing yards by a QB, 406 yards shy of Jalen Hurts. Jalen Milroe is 8th in passing yards and 7th in passing touchdowns for the Tide. Regardless of what he decides to do, Jalen has had a fantastic career at Alabama.



·        **Depth at Safety:** Reports confirm that 5th year Senior Malachi Moore will not play in the game due to injury. This along with Keon Sabb’s season ending injury force Kane Wommack to dig into the depth at Safety. Bray Hubbard has been superb filling in for Sabb, so we should expect to see him out there. Joining him will likely be freshman Xavier Mincey who converted to Safety earlier in the year to provide depth. DaShawn Jones may slide into the safety role, but will likely play the Husky, replacing Devonta Smith who transferred to Notre Dame. This is a great opportunity for younger players to get experience in the secondary and continue to compete for that starting job next fall.



·        **Opt outs:** Staying with the precedent set by Bryce Young and Will Anderson in 2022, Alabama does not have any opt outs due to the NFL draft. Michigan on the other hand has most of their NFL draft prospects sitting out. Key players sitting out for the Wolverines are RBs Kalel Mullings and Donovan Edwards; offensive lineman Myles Hinton; defensive linemen Josaiah Stewart, Mason Graham, and Kenneth Grant; and cornerback Will Johnson. Alabama will play close to full strength while the young Wolverines will need a “next man up” mentality as they are playing bare-boned.



Thank you all for a great year, I’ve enjoyed sharing my love for Bama football with all of you! This offseason I will dive deeper into the 2025 freshman class, update any transfer news, as well as begin projecting the depth chart for next season.

Roll Tide!
