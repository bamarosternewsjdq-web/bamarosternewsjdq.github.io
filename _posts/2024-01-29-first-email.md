Hello and Roll Tide!
This is your weekly update on all things Alabama Football! Enjoy the first of many depth chart projections!

The attached file contains my projected depth chart, a list of the current staff, entire scholarship Roster (excluding practice squad), 2024 recruiting class, and Transfers.

 

In case you missed it:

Kalen DeBoer signed his first two recruits this past week as 5 Star Ryan Williams recommitted to the Tide and 4 Star Noah Carter (previously committed to Washington) decided to join the Tide
Three former Washington players transferred to Alabama: Freshman Quarterback Austin Mack, Junior Wide Receiver Germie Bernard, and Sophomore Center Parker Brailsford
Freddie Roach was promoted to Assistant Head Coach while he will also retain the position of Defensive Line Coach
Kalen DeBoer hired Jatavis Sanders away from NC State for the same role as Director of Recruiting Strategy
 

Feel free to reach out with comments or questions regarding the depth chart. Iâ€™d love to hear what you think about the 2024 team.

 

Roll Tide,

Jake Q
