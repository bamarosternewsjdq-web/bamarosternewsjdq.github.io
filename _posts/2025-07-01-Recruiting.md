## Hello and Roll Tide! 

Last week was massive for Alabama as they continue to build their 2026 recruiting class. Alabama has secured six commitments in the last six days consisting of one 5-Star, two 4-Stars, and three 3-Stars (ratings by 247 Composite). These commitments launched Alabama’s 2026 class ranking up to #7 Nationally and five more potential recruits have announcements planned in the next five days. Below is a summary of the six new recruits and a list of upcoming announcements to be aware of. Let’s go!


## Six Recruits in Six Days:

·       **6/26/2025 -  Ezavier Crowell (RB)**: Crowell is the #2 running-back in the country and considered a 5-Star by Rivals.com. Ezavier is a huge recruit specifically in the state of Alabama. DeBoer and staff are investing heavily into top in-state recruits and Crowell’s commitment solidifies the efforts that they’ve made on this front. At 5-11 205lbs, Ezavier has a great frame to build out on his path to becoming a productive Alabama back.

·       **6/26/2025 – Mack Sutter (TE)**: Sutter is the #6 tight-end in the country and #1 prospect from the state of Illinois. DeBoer competed with former SEC Head Coach Brett Bielema as a surging Illinois program pushed hard for Mack’s commitment. The 6-5 prospect decided to take his talent, and size, to Tuscaloosa. He joins a very tall 2026 class as Ryan Grubb continues to prioritize height in his pass catchers.

·       **6/27/2025 – Zay Hall (LB)**: Hall is a local kid, playing his high school football for Hillcrest in Tuscaloosa. A 3-Star recruit, Hall appears to be under scouted as only one other Power-4 school offered him a scholarship. The Alabama commitment will certainly put more eyes on Hillcrest this fall, likely leading to a bump in Hall’s composite score. Alabama's internal scouts clearly liked him enough to offer, regardless of the national perception.

·       **6/29/2025 – Xavier Griffin (LB)**: Xavier is an ultra-talented linebacker out of the state of Georgia. 247Sports ranks Griffin as the #1 player in the state of Georgia, #1 linebacker in the class, and #8 overall recruit nationally. Griffin will likely play inside the ball and he’s shown skill rushing the passer. Georgia lost this huge in-state recruit to the Tide, highlighting DeBoer’s impressive recruiting prowess. With three senior linebackers on the roster, we should expect to see Griffin compete for a job as soon as he steps onto campus in 2026.

·       **6/30/2025 – Owen Cabell (WR)**: The Tide beat out Vanderbilt and Illinois for this 3-Star receiver out of Tennessee. Cabell visited Tuscaloosa on June 20th and was able to work out in-person with the staff. They were clearly impressed with him as Alabama extended an offer to him during the visit. At 6-2 Owen runs a 4.4 40-yard dash, mixing size with speed.

·       **7/1/2025 – Brian Williams Jr. (WR)**: Williams is the second wide receiver to commit to the 2026 class, one day after Cabell. Brian is 6-4, fitting the narrative that Alabama wants to get bigger at offensive skill positions. Williams plays his high school ball in Orlando, Florida, a very competitive region for high school sports. While he is only currently a 3-Star recruit, other Power 4 programs offered him a scholarship (notably Penn State, Florida, Arkansas, and Auburn).
