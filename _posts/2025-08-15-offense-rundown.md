# **Roster Rundown (in order of seniority):**

## Quarterbacks

·       #15 Ty Simpson (Redshirt Junior) – Entering his 4th season, Ty has had little experience running Alabama’s offense. Over the past 3 years Ty has attempted 50 passes completing 29 of them for 381 yards. He has not thrown a touchdown or interception. He has however rushed for 3 touchdowns. Ty is a former 5-star quarterback ranked 29th overall in the 2022 recruiting cycle. In 2021 Simpson won the Tennessee Gatorade Player of the Year as he led Westview High School to a Class 2A state championship. While Ty lacks experience at the college level, his potential remains high. Ty spent last season learning the offense as backup to Jalen Milroe and is looking to have a breakout year during Kalen DeBoer’s 2nd year behind the helm.

·       #10 Austin Mack (Redshirt Sophomore) – Mack originally committed to DeBoer at Washington as part of the 2023 class. After his freshman year he followed his head coach to Tuscaloosa. At 6-6 210, Mack has a great build to be a powerful pocket passer. Clearly DeBoer believes in Mack’s potential to fit the offensive system as he brought him over and Mack stayed with the program. It will be interesting to see if he can stay ahead of Keelon Russell in the depth chart.

·       #12 Keelon Russell (Freshman) – Keelon headlines Alabama’s 2025 Class, rated the #2 overall recruit Nationally. Keelon is the highest rated recruit to ever attend Alabama, surpassing Bryce Young. During his senior season, Russell received the honors as the 2024-2025 Gatorade National Football Player of the year. In 14 games played, Keelon threw for 4,177 yards with 55 touchdowns. Keelon is incredibly talented but will likely use his freshman year to learn DeBoer’s complex offense. I fully expect Keelon to compete for the starting position in 2026.



## Running Backs

·       #20 Dre Washington (Redshirt Senior) – Dre Washington transferred from Louisiana to Alabama with his last year of eligibility. Dre is an experienced back, rushing over 60 times each of the last 3 seasons. Dre rushed 229 times for 1,343 yards and 9 touchdowns in 32 games at Louisiana. It is difficult to see where he will land on Alabama’s depth chart, but it is worth noting that he has big play potential. In 2022 Dre had a rush that went for 54 yards, in 2023 a rush for 62 yards, 2024 a rush for 64 yards, and a reception in 2024 that went 66 yards. While he may not be the lead backup to Jam Miller, Dre will have opportunities to break defenses open.

·       #26 Jam Miller (Senior) – Jam was a 4-star recruit in the class of 2022 and has contributed to the offense all 3 years with the Tide. Last year Jam split starting duties with Justice Haynes and both saw a lower share in carries as Jalen Milroe took rushing opportunities away from the running back group. With Ty leading the offense, we should expect to see a more traditional run game. Miller will be the lead back taking the lion’s share of carries. Jam is an effective pass catcher as well. His 28-yard touchdown reception against Georgia in the 2023 SEC Championship will live forever in Alabama fans’ memories.

·       #9 Richard Young (Redshirt Sophomore) – Young appears to be the lead backup following Justice Haynes' transfer to Michigan. While he hasn’t taken many meaningful reps, Young is consistent when called upon. Young averaged 5.4 yards per carry a year ago on 27 attempts. He even showed breakaway speed against Missouri as he broke a run for 62 yards. At 5-11 212lbs, Young looks the part of a power back. We should expect to see Richard come in for short yardage run plays.

·       #4 Daniel Hill (Sophomore) – Hill was one of two 4-star running backs to commit to Alabama in the 2024 cycle. Daniel has an impressive frame. At 6-1 244lbs, he’s the biggest running back at Alabama since Derrick Henry. There’s been a lot of hype surrounding Hill this offseason as he is likely Richard Young’s top competitor for Power running attempts. Hill was not too successful a year ago averaging only 2.9 yards per carry on 21 attempts. While Hill may not see the field too often, he is a great depth option should anyone ahead of him in the depth chart miss time.

·       #28 Kevin Riley (Redshirt Freshman) – Riley was the second 4-start running back in the 2024 cycle, joining Daniel Hill. Riley is a local, he attended Tuscaloosa County High School. Riley was originally committed to the Miami Hurricanes, but decomitted and signed with his hometown team in December of 2023. Riley only appeared in two games in 2024, rushing for 30 yards on 10 carries. Riley will play a reserve role for the Tide as he continues to develop.

·       #0 AK Dear - AK went to Quitman High School in Quitman, Mississippi where he was the 4th highest rated recruit in the state. At 6-1 210lbs, Dear resembles Brian Robinson when he first got to campus. Dear shows great patience, with the ability to bull-run up the middle. He was a 100-meter track runner in high school, giving him great explosiveness should a running lane open. Dear shares similar traits with Richard Young, so we should expect Dear to be in a reserve role this season.

 

## Wide Receivers

·       #5 Germie Bernard (Senior) – Bernard is yet another former Washington player who transferred to Alabama when DeBoer signed with the Tide. Germie had a productive 2024 season, immediately showing Tide fans why DeBoer brought him over. Germie was second in receiving with 794 yards in a run-heavy offense. He is a skilled route runner and can create a lot of separation from DBs. The addition of Ryan Grubb should spark the passing offense this season. Germie will start beside Ryan Williams and is a candidate to have a breakout season.

·       #1 Isaiah Horton (Junior) – Horton transferred to Alabama from Miami (FL.). Horton was productive in 2024 catching 56 passes for 616 yards and 5 touchdowns for the Hurricanes. Horton adds size to the Alabama offense as he stands at 6-4. His speed and size allow him to win jump balls and stretch the offense. He’s expected to start at the WR-X role. Adding Horton alongside Germie and Ryan makes this wide receiver unit even more dangerous.

·       #8 Jalen Hale (Redshirt Sophomore) – Jalen Hale missed the entirety of the 2024 season due to injury, receiving a medical redshirt. Jalen was the #6 ranked WR in the class of 2023 and made several splash plays during his freshman season. Hale caught 5 passes for 148 yards, averaging 29.6 yards per reception, establishing himself as a deep ball threat. Jalen will look to provide depth to the wide receiver room in 2025.

·       #13 Cole Adams (Redshirt Sophomore) – Cole was lightly recruited, ranked #303 nationally in the 2023 class. Cole played very little his freshman year but started to carve out a role in 2024. Cole returned punts and found himself receiving multiple reps in the slot. Adams’ season was cut short when he received a season ending injury against Missouri. Cole showed a strong zone-understanding and was consistent returning punts. I expect him to get reps at both positions again in 2025.

·       #2 Ryan Williams (Sophomore) – Ryan aka Hollywood is one of the most famous Alabama players in recent history. He shares the cover of the EA Sports College Football 26 video game with Jeremiah Smith of Ohio State. Ryan was full of special plays during his freshman year as he finished with 865 yards and 8 touchdowns. Like Germie, Ryan should see increased production in 2025 as Ryan Grubb takes over play calling. Ryan has the potential to be an All-time great Wide Receiver, should he continue to grow with Alabama.

·       #11 Rico Scott (Sophomore) – Rico saw limited time on offense in 2024 but was involved on special teams as a gunner. Rico was a big-play receiver in high school showing off elite speed. It’s been reported out of Fall camp that Rico has topped 23 miles per hour multiple times. Rico may be buried in the depth chart, but speed like that should get him looks in shot- plays and potentially on special teams as a returner. Scott has the potential to be a breakout player in 2025.

·       #3 Jaylen Mbakwe (Sophomore) – Jaylen headlined the 2024 class with Ryan Williams and was an active supporter of the “new wave”. However, after his freshman season, Mbakwe entered the transfer portal to renegotiate his NIL deal. After agreeing to a new sum, Mbakwe moved to Wide Receiver. Jaylen showed explosiveness returning punts a year ago. It will be interesting to see how he develops on the offensive side of the ball.

·       #6 Bubba Hampton (Redshirt Freshman) – Bubba entered Alabama with Ryan Williams and Rico Scott as part of the 2024 class. During his freshman season, Bubba only saw action against Mercer where he caught one pass for 6 yards. Hampton entered Alabama undersized at 175lbs. He was a speedster running the 100-meter dash in high school. He is now up to 195lbs, filling out his frame nicely. Bubba will likely remain in a reserve role during the 2025 season.

·       #30 Derek Meadows (Freshman) - Meadows attended national powerhouse Bishop Gorman where he played at the Varsity level all 4 years. 247 has him listed at 6-5 208lbs with an 80” wingspan. As well, Meadows won the Nevada 2023 Gatorade Track and Field Player of the Year as he won state in the 300m hurdles and took 2nd in the 110m hurdles. His size, speed, and raw athleticism could make Meadows a nightmare matchup for smaller defensive backs. He could see playing time right away in red zone situations.

·        #17 Lotzeir Brooks (Freshman) - Brooks attended Millville High School in Millville, New Jersey where he set the state records for career receiving yards (4,615), receptions (223), and touchdowns (67). At 5-9 188lbs, he’s a bit undersized but makes up for that with pure speed. Brooks’ speed makes him a candidate to return punts and provide depth at wide receiver.

 

## Tight Ends

·       #80 Josh Cuevas (Redshirt Senior) – Cuevas joined the Tide in 2024, transferring over with DeBoer from Washington. Before playing at Washington, Cuevas had a productive 2022 season at California Polytechnic catching 58 passes for 678 yards and 6 touchdowns. Cuevas showed flashes of that form with the Tide a season ago. His big highlight came against Wisconsin when he caught a 37-yard pass for a touchdown, running a tight end seam route. Cuevas is expected to be Alabama’s starter in the TE-Y position where he should see a hefty number of pass-catching opportunities.

·       #89 Brody Dalton (Redshirt Senior) – Dalton is from Fyffe, Alabama and spent his first four college seasons in-state at UAB and Troy. In his career, Dalton has caught 24 passes for 339 yards and 3 touchdowns. Listed at 6-5 251lbs, Dalton will likely be used in goal line situations as a blocker, with the occasional play action pass. Dalton is in consideration to start at the TE-H position.

·       #86 Peter Knudson (Redshirt Senior) – Knudson transferred to Alabama after spending the last 4 seasons with Weber State. In high school, Peter played both quarterback and punter at McCall-Donnelly High School where he was named the Idaho 2A player of the year. At Weber State, Knudson appeared in 20 total games catching 9 passes for 63 yards. Knudson joined the Tide to provide depth to a tight end group with plenty of question marks.

·       #86 Danny Lewis (Redshirt Junior) – Danny Lewis enrolled at Alabama in 2022 as the lowest rated of 3 tight ends in his class. He’s been in a reserve role all 3 years so far, only catching 1 pass in his career. Lewis entered the Transfer Portal in December but was recruited back by Courtney Morgan and staff. Lewis is a breakout candidate as playing time is up for grabs at tight end.

·       #48 Jayden Hobson (Redshirt Sophomore) – Hobson grew up in Tuscaloosa, attending both Hillcrest and Paul W. Bryant High Schools. Initially recruited as an offensive tackle, Hobson committed to Mississippi State in 2023 then transferred to South Alabama in 2024. Alabama took Hobson in and converted him to tight end. Hobson’s cut down 40 lbs now sitting at 6-5 255lbs. Expect Hobson to be a project at tight end and exclusively come in to block.

·       #85 Jack Sammarco (Sophomore) – Jack was a three-star prospect out of Anderson High School in Cincinnati, Ohio. He spent his freshman season at West Virginia before entering the transfer portal in the spring. Sammarco played almost exclusively on special teams, hauling in one catch for 5 yards during the 2024 season. Sammarco will provide blocking depth at a position that has become crowded via the transfer portal.

·       #88 Jay Lindsey (Redshirt Freshman) – Lindsey is from Butler, Alabama where he played High School football at Patrician Academy. A 3-star recruit, Lindsey was targeted due to his size, standing at 6-5. Jay saw limited playing time in 2024, recording one catch against Mercer.

·       #81 Kaleb Edwards (Freshman) – Kaleb is a big tight end (6-6 255lbs) from El Dorado Hills, California. Edwards played Varsity Football and Basketball at Oak Ridge. His basketball skills can be seen on the football field as Kaleb excels in 50/50 jump-ball situations. At his size, he is also an established blocker. Tight ends typically need time to develop, so we may not see Edwards play this season other than special teams.

·       #18 Marshall Pritchett (Freshman) – Pritchett played varsity ball at Rabun Gap-Nacoochee High School in Georgia. Marshall started his career at Quarterback before moving to wide receiver. As he filled out his 6-5 frame, Pritchett eventually moved to Tight End. His experience at quarterback makes him a high IQ receiver who can often take advantage of zone-coverage. Pritchett will need to develop as a blocker before seeing any meaningful time with Alabama.

## Offensive Line

·       #77 Jaeden Roberts (Redshirt Senior) – Jaeden stepped onto the scene in 2023 making his first career start against Texas A&M. He immediately sparked the offense, specifically as a bruiser in the run game. Roberts has started ever since, only missing the Mercer game in 2024 due to injury. Jaeden is dealing with an injury which caused him to miss the Tide’s first scrimmage of the Fall. Roberts is expected to start against FSU and be a leader on the offensive line.

·       #56 Geno VanDeMark (Redshirt Senior) – Geno transferred to Alabama in 2024 after spending 3 seasons at Michigan State. VanDeMark provides depth at many positions: started 1 game at left guard, 1 game at right guard, and came in as the backup at center all during the 2024 season. Geno is in a position battle with Kam Dewberry to start at left guard. If Jaeden Roberts misses time at right guard, Geno will be the first backup there. Geno will impact the 2025 Alabama football team regardless of if he wins the starting job at left guard.

·       #71 Kam Dewberry (Senior) – Dewberry transferred to Alabama in December of 2024 after spending the last 3 years with Texas A&M. Dewberry was a top 100 prospect in the class of 2022. He played in 32 total games at Texas A&M making 8 starts. Immediately, Dewberry finds himself competing to take over Tyler Booker’s previous role at left guard.

·       #72 Parker Brailsford (Redshirt Junior) – Brailsford started all 13 games for the Tide in 2024, after following DeBoer to Tuscaloosa from Washington. Parker was part of the 2023 Joe Moore award winning offensive line at Washington. Brailsford is a skilled center who will provide veteran leadership to the line. He is on the preseason watchlist for the Rimington Trophy.

·       #74 Kaydn Proctor (Junior) – Kaydn may be the best left tackle in all of college football this season. Some experts have him projected as a top 10 NFL pick in 2026. Proctor was much improved a season ago, after an up-and-down freshman year in 2023. With two years of experience under his belt, Proctor will be a force on the left side of the line for the Tide.

·       #75 Wilkin Formby (Redshirt Sophomore) – Wilkin started two games at right tackle a season ago, before being replaced by Elijah Pritchett. Elijah transferred to Nebraska, opening an opportunity for Formby to reclaim the starting role. Formby is expected to be the starter in 2025 with Olaus Alinen as his primary competition. Formby played in nine games a season ago, valuable experience that should get him the starting nod to start the season.

·       #73 Olaus Alinen (Redshirt Sophomore) – Born in Pori, Finland, Olaus moved to the United States and played high school football at The Loomis Chaffee School in Connecticut. Olaus played in all 13 games in 2024 with Special Teams. Olaus provided depth to the O-Line unit recording 65 snaps across 4 games.  Recruited a tackle, Alinen will provide depth at right and left tackle this season.

·       #55 Roq Montgomery (Redshirt Sophomore) – Roq is from Anniston, Alabama and was a part of the 2022 class. In 2024, Roq carved out a role on Special Teams. Roq took 68 snaps on the offensive line across 5 games in clean-up roles. Roq is expected to provide depth at Center in 2025 before competing for the starting role in 2026.

·       #76 Arkel Anugwom (Redshirt Sophomore) -  Born in Nigeria, Arkel moved to Antioch, Tennessee and attended Antioch High School. Arkel spent his first 2 collegiate seasons at Ball State where he played in 4 games for the Redbirds before transferring to Alabama. Anugwom had zero stars out of high school but rose to a 3-star prospect in the transfer portal. Arkel will be a project on the offensive line.

·       #50 Casey Poe (Redshirt Freshman) – Poe was a highly recruited tackle in the 2024 cycle, rated #2 Nationally at the interior offensive line position. Out of Lindale, Texas, Poe received 23 offers out of High School. Poe saw action in two games during mop-up duty against Western Kentucky and Mercer. He gained experience on the scout team and was the scout player of the week leading up to the LSU game. Poe will provide depth and look for a role on Special Teams in 2025.

·       #69 Joseph Ionata (Redshirt Freshman) – Ionata attended Calvary Christian High School in Clearwater, Florida before joining Alabama’s 2024 recruiting class. He started at left tackle for 3 years but was recruited as an interior lineman. Ionata played in two games a season ago totaling 47 snaps at center. He will continue to develop in a reserve role this season.

·       #70 William Sanders (Redshirt Freshman) – Sanders attended Brookwood High School in Brookwood, Alabama where he was the #19 recruit in the state. A 4-star recruit, William chose Alabama over LSU, NC State, Missouri, and Vanderbilt. During his freshman year, Sanders saw playing time late in blowouts against Western Kentucky and Mercer. He will continue to develop in a reserve role this season.

·       #64 Michael Carroll (Freshman) - Carroll played varsity football at National Powerhouse IMG Academy and he entered Alabama with a similar frame as IMG alumni Tyler Booker. Carroll was a 5-star recruit, the #1 ranked interior offensive lineman and #17 overall player in the 2025 cycle. At 6-6 315lbs, Michael will compete immediately for a backup role.

·       #57 Jackson Lloyd (Freshman) – Jackson Lloyd was the #7 offensive tackle in the class of 2025. Lloyd stands at a massive 6-7 315lbs and can play either left or right tackle. He was a three-sport athlete, notably a very athletic forward in basketball. Lloyd will need to put on muscle before starting but can provide depth at the tackle position in 2025.

·       #65 Micah DeBose (Freshman) – Standing at 6-5 325lbs, DeBose is the heaviest offensive lineman in the 2025 class. Projected as an interior lineman, Micah has experience playing the tackle position. DeBose played basketball and threw shot put, displaying both athleticism and strength. Depending on need, Micah will likely try out multiple positions along the line.

·       #52 Mal Waldrep (Freshman) – Mal is an instate prospect who attended Central High School in Phenix City. Waldrep primarily played left tackle for his 7A program, but at 322lbs he could easily slide into the guard position or center. On3 has him listed as IOL while 247 lists him as an OT. Waldrep will develop this season in a reserve role.
