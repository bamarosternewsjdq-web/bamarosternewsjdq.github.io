## Hello and Roll Tide!

On Saturday, Alabama will take on the Oklahoma Sooners, hoping to exact revenge after a blowout loss at Norman a year ago. Last year’s loss took Alabama out of the playoff conversation and this game could have significant playoff repercussions for both teams. Alabama controls their own destiny, still undefeated in conference play with all of their goals still in front of them. Oklahoma is in must-win territory so Alabama will certainly get their best shot. DeBoer and staff were embarrassed a season ago and look to flip the script. Below are Injury Notes, a Week 12 Preview, and Week 12 story lines. Let’s go!


### <u>Injury Notes</u>
-   Freshman LB Abduall Sanders Jr. was added as OUT
-   Qua Russaw and Cayden Jones are both QUESTIONABLE
-   DaShawn Jones remains as PROBABLE


### <u>Week 12 Preview: Oklahoma Sooners</u>

Oklahoma enters week 12 with a record of 7-2 (3-2) and are ranked 11th in the College Football Playoff Rankings. Oklahoma had a rocky first season in the SEC, going 6-7 (2-6) in 2024 and now find themselves in the Playoff conversation. Many people had Brent Venables on the hot seat, but it’s cooled down this season. Venables faced the Tide 4 times as the Defensive Coordinator at Clemson, splitting the series 2-2. He is currently 1-0 against the Tide as a Head Coach. Oklahoma has had Alabama’s number in recent history, winning 3 of the last 4 dating back to 2002. The one Alabama win came in 2018 when the Tide defeated Kyler Murray’s #4 Sooners in the Orange Bowl. Oklahoma made 3 consecutive CFB Playoffs from 2017-2019 but have not been back since. Venables has them back in the playoff picture in his 4th season with the Sooners.

The main addition to the team during the offseason was Washington State transfer QB John Mateer. Mateer had a productive 2024, passing for 3,139 yards and 29 touchdowns. He was excellent to start the 2025 season. In his first 4 games with Oklahoma, Mateer averaged 304 passing ypg, 47.5 rushing ypg, threw 6 touchdowns, and rushed for 5 more. After the 4th game, Mateer had surgery on his throwing hand missing 2 weeks before returning against Texas. Since returning from injury his numbers have declined. Mateer is averaging 183.5 passing ypg, 29 rushing ypg, has 2 passing touchdowns, and 1 rushing touchdown in the last 4 games. Oklahoma’s offense has not been as productive since Mateer’s surgery. Still the lack of production has been enough to win games. The run game is led by true Freshman Tory Baylock who was the 17th highest rated RB in the 2025 class. Baylock has rushed for 401 yards and 4 touchdowns this season, averaging 4.3 yards per carry. He splits duties with Sophomore Xavier Robinson. Robinson is an explosive back, averaging 6.4 yards per carry with a long of 64-yards. Alabama has been susceptible to the run this season, and these are two capable running backs. Mateer’s favorite targets have been Isaiah Sategna III and Deion Burks who have 49 and 42 catches respectively. Burks was a top WR transfer in the 2024 class, moving from Purdue to Oklahoma. Sategna was a 4-star out of High School and committed to Arkansas before transferring to Oklahoma in 2025. 

Brent Venables is a defensive head coach so it is fitting that Oklahoma’s strength is their defense. In 2024 Oklahoma was a top-30 defense in both Points allowed and Yards per game. The Sooners are even better this year, ranked 7th nationally in both categories. Oklahoma brought in productive transfers in the offseason. Notably EDGE Marvin Jones Jr. and LB Kendal Daniels. Marvin Jones Jr. was a 5-star out of High School, spending his first two years at Georgia, then one season with FSU. Jones started the previous 3 years at Oklahoma State and was top-2 on the team in tackles the past 2 seasons. These skilled players join a talented linebacker group including Junior Kip Lewis and Junior Owen Heinecke who lead the team in tackles with 53 and 46 respectively. With this much talent in the front-7, Oklahoma is a top-4 rush defense in the country. They also rank 3rd in the SEC with 33 sacks this season. The constant pressure helps the secondary who is allowing only 181 passing ypg, 23rd nationally. Oklahoma’s secondary will be challenged facing Alabama who has been one-dimensional on offense this season. 


### <u>Week 12 Storylines:</u>

**Strength vs Weakness:** It is no secret that Alabama has been struggling to run the football. No matter who they rotate in on the offensive line, blocks are missed and they cannot push the defensive line back. That should not change on Saturday as the Tide take on a top-4 rush defense in Oklahoma. Even without a run-game, Alabama’s offense has been great with Ty and all of the talented pass-catchers. Alabama should lean into their strength throwing the football and not worry about Oklahoma’s strength stopping the run.

**Focus on the Right-Now:** Alabama does not have a conference loss, which provides flexibility should they drop a game against Oklahoma or Auburn. RAT POISON! Alabama cannot afford to look ahead. They need to attack Oklahoma as they’ve done everyone on their schedule thus far. The last thing Alabama needs is to leave the SEC Championship and CFB Playoff up to an away game in Jordan-Hare Stadium. 1-0 mentality. BEAT THE SOONERS!

**Copy-Cat/BYE Week Syndrome:** Alabama has had the misfortune to play Georgia, Missouri, LSU, and now Oklahoma after each team had a BYE week. The Tide have taken care of business thus far, but last season Oklahoma was in the same situation and took advantage of the extra time. They were able to successfully Copy-Cat Vanderbilt’s offense and took down the Tide in Norman. Will they once again take the Copy-Cat approach? Florida State ran a heavy motion/QB Run offense against Alabama with success in week 1. John Mateer is a mobile quarterback so I expect to see Brent Venables’ best Florida State impression on Saturday. Kane Wommack has Alabama’s defense playing at a high level. Will they be prepared to face a similar offense to what beat them in week 1?
