## Good morning and Roll Tide! 

Alabama Hoops are 21-3, currently tied for 1st in the SEC. There are 7 games left before the SEC tournament and the Tide are #2 in the AP poll, #1 in the Coaches poll, #6 overall in Ken Pom (#2 offense, #40 defense), and #6 in the NET Rankings (8-3 in Quad 1 games.) Alabama’s second half of SEC play is grueling. Alabama took care of Arkansas and Texas, which could have easily been trap games, as both teams are fighting for a spot in the NCAA tournament. To finish the season, the Tide have 7 Quad 1 games starting with #1 Auburn at home. The Auburn game is followed by a road trip to #21 Missouri, hosting #15 Kentucky and #22 Mississippi state, a trip to #5 Tennessee, #3 Florida at home, and finally a trip to #1 Auburn. This is likely the most difficult stretch of 7 games anyone has had all season. These games will have a massive impact on seeding for both the SEC and NCAA tournaments. If Alabama can make it through this stretch with only 1-2 losses, they should be a top-4 seed in the SEC tournament positioning them to be a 1-seed in the NCAA tournament. ESPN analyst Jay Bilas said that this season’s SEC may be the most dominant conference ever so winning the conference would be an even bigger accomplishment than usual. Alabama’s only conference loss this season was at home against Ole Miss, but they’ve improved every game since then. While turnovers remain, the Tide have seen improvements in 3-point shooting and defensive efficiency. Oats uses the Alabama depth effectively. Bama has blown some big leads in the 2nd half, yet Oats is always willing to change-up lineups when he thinks other players may provide a spark.


## Preview: Iron Bowl of Basketball

For the first time in Conference History the #1 and #2 AP teams will face off in the SEC regular season. This is the most anticipated IBOB of all time. The rivalry has heated up the last 5 years as Oats and Pearl have been building their programs, yet this is the first time they will meet at the top of their game. Both teams only have 1 conference loss, so outside of NCAA implications, this will give one team a big edge to win the SEC regular season. Auburn is 22-2, #1 in the AP Poll and #1 in Ken Pom (#1 offense/ #17 defense). Their two losses are at Duke and vs Florida. They are led by John Broome who is a finalist for player of the year: he is averaging 18.1 ppg and 10.7 rpg. Like Alabama, one of Auburn’s biggest strengths is their depth. Auburn has 5 players averaging over 10 points per game. The keys to this matchup will likely be 3-point differential and points in the paint. Alabama defends the 3-point line best in the SEC, yet they allow 2-pointers at the highest rate in the conference. Auburn’s strength is getting Broome the ball in the paint, however they have 4 guards shooting 40% or more from the 3-point line. Alabama needs to stop Broome without giving up open looks outside. Cliff Omoruyi will be tasked with defending Broome, yet we should expect Grant, Mo D, and Sherrel to step in as well. Auburn plays with 2 strong Centers so the Tide will be challenged for rebounds all game long. Aden Holloway is another story to watch, as this is his first game against his former team. Holloway could not find his footing at Auburn, but has really come into form lately with the Tide. Homefield advantage should certainly play into today’s game as this is the biggest game ever at Coleman Coliseum. If Alabama can shoot the 3-ball effectively and run at a faster pace than Auburn, they should be able to make it out with a win. Prediction: Tide win 87-80.


## Player Notes for the Season: 

**Mark Sears 16.8 ppg, 4.9 AST** - Sears is the glue to the team but hasn’t had to be a 1 man show. The depth of this team has allowed him to play off ball more, giving him more catch and shoot opportunities. His 3-point shooting is up to 35.7%. While Sears could improve his turnovers, his leadership has been paramount to this team’s success. 

**Labaron Philon 10.4ppg, 3.5AST** - Although Labaron’s stats have dropped since the start of SEC play, NBA scouts project that he will be selected in the late 1st round. A slight injury mixed with the emergence of a healthy Chris Youngblood has limited Labaron’s playing time. Philon now comes off the bench and provides a lot of energy to the second unit, with a great attitude. His love for this team generates a lot of energy for the backups.

**Grant Nelson 12.7ppg, 8.1REB** - Grant is 2nd  on the team in scoring as he’s been one of the most consistent players for the Tide this season. While he hasn’t shot the ball well from 3, he consistently gets good looks in the paint and plays with high energy. He needs to improve his free-throw percentage as often he is fouled in late game situations.

**Cliff Omoruyi 7ppg, 6.3REB** - Cliffs stats won’t jump off the page but he has been the glue for the Tide’s defense down low. He is a very skilled big, excelling in dunking and catching oops down low. His defense is what sets him apart. Cliff fills a role that was missing from last season as he can tackle teams who rely on Center play. While his minutes per game are lower than we may like, he will make a big impact on games moving forward.  

**Jarin Stevenson 5.5ppg, 3.6 REB** - Many wrote off Jarin this season after a very slow start but Oats believes in him. Oats praises Jarin’s improvement in practice as well as his effort on the defensive side of the ball. This has led to him starting most games this year. Against Texas Jarin erupted for a careet high 22 points, shooting 4 of 5 from 3. After starting the season 0-18 from 3, his percentage is up to 38%.

**Derrion Reid 7.2 ppg, 3.4 REB** - Derrion Reid has not played since January 11th as he’s been dealing with an injury for most of SEC play. The recovery has had multiple issues as he’s been unable to practice. Derrion needs improvement on his shot but he is a great inside scorer and a tremendous defender. Having him on the bench would be huge as Alabama pushes toward the end of the season.

**Aden Holloway 11.8 ppg 2.0 AST** - Biz has been the biggest story of SEC play so far. The former Auburn star has shown out shooting 50% from 3 during SEC play and is now Alabama’s 3rd leading scorer. He has a very quick shot and has come off the bench on a mission. Oats gives Aden the green light from 3, as he joked the other night that Aden should be shooting like he did at South Dakota State where he attempted 19 3-pointers. Holloway will be the Tide’s difference maker this year due to his hot shooting and second-team ball handling.

**Chris Youngblood 9.7ppg, 2.7 REB** - Chris Youngblood has emerged as not only a starter but one of the leaders of the team. Youngblood is a Tuscaloosa native and is playing his 5th and final year for his hometown Tide. Oats said that he’d love to have Youngblood on his coaching staff, praising his knowledge and leadership on this team. Youngblood had a slow start after his injury, but has emerged as a starter and is shooting 36.6% from 3. He has the quickest shot release of the team and has great range but can also drive and finish well under the rim.

**Mohammad Dioubate 6ppg, 5.4REB** - Mo D has become a fan favorite and the best effort guy on the team, similar to Herb Jones. Bama would not be #2 in the country without the effort that Mo D provides.  leads the team this year with 9 hard hat awards and Oats continually praises his effort. There’s room for improvement on the offensive side of the ball, but his offensive rebounding and loose ball effort cannot be understated.

**Aiden Sherrel 2.1ppg 2.8REB** - Aiden’s minutes have increased since SEC play started and the freshman looks more comfortable out on the court. He had a career game against Georgia: scoring 12 points and shot 2-3 from deep. Oats praised his shooting ability during practice and publicly gave him the green light. As for next steps, if he becomes a more aggressive defender and can finish better around the rim, he should have a great future with Alabama.

**Latrell Wrightsell 11.5 ppg 2.0 AST** - Latrell is out for the season but has announced he will medically redshirt and come back next year 

**Houston Mallette 3.2 ppg , 2.2 rebounds** - Mallete hasn’t played since the beginning of SEC play after a flair up with his knees. His status is unknown since he planned to redshirt at the beginning of the season but has played 6 games. Oats will likely try to medically redshirt him for next season. 

**Naas Cunningham** - Hasn’t played due to be redshirted as a freshmen 

 
## Storylines:

**Alabama’s Depth** -  Depth is the strength of this team. Sears, Grant, Youngblood, Philon, and Holloway lead the team in minutes, respectfully. Next are forwards Cliff, Jarin, and Mo D. Sherrel has been in more of a reserve role, but has seen his minutes increase recently. Derrion should return to add depth as well. This 10-man lineup can match any team’s size and create mismatches. It also allows Oats to rotate different guys in if they’re hot. Aden has been heating up, allowing Oats to throw him out there when we need a spark. Mo D can provide a defensive jolt of energy if effort is low. Once this line-up is refined, Alabama should be able to beat anyone in the country.

**Three point shooting** – Alabama started the season shooing 31% from beyond the arc before SEC play and have shot 38% against SEC opponents. This significant increase shows that Alabama has not yet hit their true potential. Top Teams like Duke and Auburn have been shooting well all season, while Alabama continues to get better. Alabama ran Texas off the floor shooting 58% from 3. When they are hot from deep, this team can beat anyone in the country. percent every night but this shows what they can do and shows how good this team will be to finish this season. Hopefully the tide can keep improving their 3 point shot and get hot at the right time.
