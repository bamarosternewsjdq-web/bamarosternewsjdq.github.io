## Hello and Roll Tide!

The offseason is in full swing! The deadline to enter the portal closed on January 16th, but schools can still add players who are in the portal. Alabama lost 21 scholarship players. This may sound like a lot, but it is comparable to other top programs: Ohio State lost 34; Oregon lost 28; Tennessee lost 28; Texas lost 26. Alabama is still working to add players from the portal, but as of right now they’ve already added 15 players. It appears that the staff is mainly focused on the line of scrimmage. Alabama lost 6 offensive linemen to the portal and have already added 5. Bama lost 4 defensive linemen and 2 edge rushers and replaced them with 4 linemen and 2 edge rushers. The staff clearly identified the line of scrimmage as an area that needed adjustment. Below is a list of portal additions and who was lost. I will send out an update later in the offseason introducing the new portal additions.
