Hello and Roll Tide!

This past weekend was huge for Recruiting in the state of Alabama. The Crimson Tide hosted the Champions Cook-Out while the slimy Auburn Tigers hosted a Big-Cat Cook-Out of their own across the state. The weekend resulted in two de-commitments in the class of 25, and two verbal commitments to the class of 2027. Below are the details:

4 Star Defensive Lineman Antonio Coleman decommitted from Alabama and committed to Auburn
4 Star Athlete Derick Smith decommitted from Alabama and committed to Auburn
Alabama received their first verbal commits for the 2027 Class (Sophomores in HS)
In-state Edge defender Ba’Roc Willis
In-state Edge defender Jabarrius Garror
 

With practice getting underway, I made adjustments to the Depth-chart labeled 2.2. Below are the Depth Chart updates:

Added incoming transfers Jose Cuevas, Kameron Howard, Geno VanDeMark, Andre Craig, and DaShawn Jones
Caleb Odem moved from Tight End to Wide Receiver
Removed Steve Mboumoua who will be attending Southwest Mississippi Community College before heading to Tuscaloosa
Removed Peyton Woodyard who transferred to Oregon

For those of you who bought the new College Football game for PS5 or XBOX X|S, you may have noticed that the Bama Roster does not match 
what I’ve been sending each week. Some players opted out, others transferred in after the deadline to make it into the game. As well, 
there are plenty of fake players that EA put into the game to fill out the Roster. My notes are below:

 

Quarterback – All scholarship athletes are included
Running Back – All scholarship athletes are included
Wide Receiver -
Missing: Kameron Howard, Rico Scott, Andre Craig
Fake: Durante Basher
Tight End –
Missing: Josh Cuevas, Jay Lindsey
Fake: Garrick Sanders
Offensive Line – All scholarship athletes are included
Defencisive Line –
Missing: Tim Smith, James Smith, Jordan Renaud
Fake: Lamarcus Fox, Simeon Patrick, Derrick Vincent-Douglass, Xavier McCoy
Linebackers –
