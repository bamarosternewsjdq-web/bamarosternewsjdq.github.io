### Hello and Roll Tide! 
Shoutout to Megan who guessed the game score correctly! Thanks to everyone for sending comments and questions!

Alabama won their 3rd consecutive ranked SEC matchup on Saturday as they took down the Missouri Tigers 27-24. This is the first time that an SEC program has defeated 3 consecutive ranked opponents in 3 straight weeks. Alabama improves to 5-1 (3-0) as they continue to impress. Kalen DeBoer improves to 12-2 while wearing his black hoodie on the sideline, as the fashion choice makes waves across the media. This was a well fought match by Mizzou as they kept in the game until Dijon Lee’s game-sealing interception with 37 seconds left on the clock. Kalen DeBoer has a reputation for winning one-score games. He is 16-5 in one-score games since the start of 2022, something Alabama has done twice in the last 3 weeks. Below are injury updates, depth notes, a week 7 recap, and week 7 storylines revisited. Let’s go!


### **Injury Updates:**
-   Derek Meadows exited the game in the 1st quarter with a concussion as a result of a targeting penalty

-   Jam Miller received a concussion on a hard hit, exiting in the 4th quarter
-   Jalen Hale missed the game with an undisclosed injury
-   Cayden Jones missed week 7 and had ankle surgery. He will be out several weeks


### **Depth Notes:**
-   Freshman corner Dijon Lee out-snapped Domani Jackson 48 to 22
-   Daniel Hill filled in for Jam Miller after the injury

### **Week 7 Recap: Mizzou**
**Offense:** Alabama’s offense started out hot, scoring on their first three possessions. There was a lull from the end of the first half through the third quarter, but the Tide stepped up in clutch time. Ty Simpson was a difference maker in this game. He passed for 200 yards with 3 touchdowns and distributed the ball all over the field. Ty completed passes to 8 different receivers (excluding Parker Brailsford’s catch off of a tip). Lotzier Brooks led the team with 58 receiving yards and converted big 3rd and 4th downs. He was the recipient of a 29-yard completion on 4th & 8 in the 4th quarter. Isaiah Horton caught a 16-yard touchdown pass from Ty on a 3rd & 12. The running backs also got involved in the pass game as both Kevin Riley and Daniel Hill caught touchdown passes. Josh Cuevas has separated himself as the top receiving option in the tight end room. He shows great zone awareness as Ty continues to find him sitting in soft spots. On the opening drive, Josh ran behind a defender, then sat in front of the safety where Ty delivered a strike for 21-yards. The most surprising stat from the receiving core was Ryan Williams recording zero catches on the day. Ryan did not look like he was 100% and only took 41% of the total snaps. Derek Meadows saw snaps early in the contest before being the victim of a vicious targeting penalty. Ty continues to be incredibly accurate and this aerial assault is one of the most dangerous in the country.
Jam Miller continued to show us how much he was missed to open the season. Before his injury, Jam was averaging 4.3 yards per carry on 20 attempts. Kevin Riley and Daniel Hill averaged 2.7 yards per carry on their 12 combined attempts. Jam also caught 4 passes for 25 yards. Jam was forced out of the game from another questionable hit, although referees did not deem the hit targeting. Alabama’s offense has looked much better since Jam returned to action. Hopefully he has a speedy recovery. In his absence, Daniel Hill took most of his reps. Kevin Riley will continue to be involved in a “change of pace” role. Expect these two backs to handle most of the volume while Jam is out.


**Defense:** Similar to the start of the Vanderbilt game, Alabama’s defense allowed a quick score to Missouri and looked like they were in trouble. The defense rebounded quickly forcing 3 consecutive punts. While the stats may not suggest it (Bama allowed 5.8 yards per carry), Alabama did a good job stopping the run. Jamal Roberts 39-yard run and Beau’s two scrambles for 35-yards skew the data. The big win for Alabama’s rush defense was limiting the SEC rushing leader Ahmad Hardy to 52 yards on 12 carries. Going into the game, Alabama’s mediocre rush defense was the focal point as they faced the best rushing offense in the conference and Alabama held strong. LT Overton, Yhonzae Pierre, Nikhai Hill-Green, and London Simmons jumped off the screen making big plays during this game. LT recorded 1.5 sacks and 1.5 tackles for a loss. Yhonzae Pierre was very disruptive, constantly pressuring Beau Pribula. Yhonzae also forced two fumbles. Nikhai Hill-Green had great positioning, often plugging run gaps. He led Alabama with 7 tackles, even though he played less snaps than the other 2 middle linebackers. While London Simmons only played 14 snaps, his presence was felt. London had a pressure and a sack against the Tigers, seemingly blowing up the line whenever he was in. 
The secondary was shaky on the first drive, notably Domani Jackson. On Brett Norfleet’s 26-yard touchdown reception, Domani was positioned correctly, but seemingly walked out of bounds allowing a free touchdown. This did not go unnoticed as Kane immediately replaced him with Freshman Dijon Lee. Dijon Lee played very well, recording a pass deflection and interception. Dijon should have had 2 interceptions, barely dropping one in the 2nd quarter. Bray Hubbard also played well in the secondary, recording a pass deflection and interception. He did have one miscue in run support, getting juked out by Beau Pribula on the 2-yard line, leading to a touchdown. While this defense may not be the back breaking, 1st round loaded teams of the past, they do put Alabama in a position to win. The defense comes up with stops when they need it and don’t allow too many points to be scored. This was an impressive performance against one of the best offensive lines in the country. 

**Special Teams:** Skilled position players were the bright spots of yet another disappointing Special Teams showing on Saturday. Cole Adams’ great hands were on display as he recovered Missouri’s onside kick attempt. He has been a consistent punt returner this season and his sure hands solidify the value that he brings to Special Teams. Dre Washington might have made the play of the day, stopping Mizzou’s fake punt attempt in the 4th quarter. Dre noticed that backup running back Jamal Roberts stayed on the field for Mizzou, then forced him out of bounds just shy of the 1st down marker. Outside of these big plays, Conor Talty and Blake Doud were lackluster. Conor made a field goal from 22-yards and 47-yards but missed a 49-yard attempt. Talty is an average college kicker, something that we are not used to after Will Reichard and Graham Nicholson’s tenures. Blake Doud attempted 3 punts averaging 33.7 yards per punt, one traveling only 27-yards net. Penalties were also an issue on Special Teams. There was a holding penalty on a punt return and an illegal formation on a punt. There’s plenty to clean up on Special teams.


### **Week 7 Storylines Revisited**
**Can Alabama win on 3rd down?:** Alabama was better at 3rd down on both sides of the ball on Saturday. Missouri entered the game best in the country in offensive 3rd down conversion percentage and Alabama held them to 1 for 11 on 3rd down. Alabama’s rush defense contained Mizzou running backs, forcing many 3rd and long scenarios. The defensive line had Beau under constant pressure. At the same time, the secondary was effective in their coverage, making it difficult for Missouri anytime they got to third down. On the other side of the ball, Alabama was successful on 6 of 15 3rd down conversions (40%), higher than Mizzou’s previous percentage allowed (22.5%). As well, Alabama converted all three 4th down attempts, adding to an impressive conversion rate in clutch situations. Winning both sides of 3rd down was a big part of Alabama’s victory.

**Strength vs Weakness:** Entering Saturday, Missouri led the SEC in rushing while Alabama was near the bottom in rush defense. Alabama did allow some explosive plays, but contained Ahmad Hardy most of the game. Stopping the run forced Missouri into passing situations where Alabama was able to take advantage. 

**Ty for Heisman (Ty-sman):** Ty once again had another special performance in SEC play. Ty had several highlight plays: Ty split two zone defenders finding Josh Cuevas for a 21-yard completion on the opening drive; Ty looked off the safety and threw a dart to Isaiah Horton in the back of the endzone for a 16-yard touchdown in the 2nd quarter; Ty scrambled for 20-yards on 3rd & 4 for the conversion; Ty picked up a 4th & 1 finding Jam on a QB RPO; on 4th & 8 in the late 4th quarter, Ty delivered a strike to Lotzier Brooks for 29-yards and a 1st down; on 4th and goal, Ty found Daniel Hill on a quick flat into the endzone. These highlights are examples of why Ty Simpson rose to national recognition. Ty has found himself as a Heisman favorite, but everything he says tells us that he cares more about team success than individual achievement. Regardless, while Ty is having this much success, Alabama is very difficult to stop.
