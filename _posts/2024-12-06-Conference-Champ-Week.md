## Hello and Roll Tide! 

Last Saturday the Alabama Crimson Tide defeated the Auburn Tigers 28-14 in the 89th Iron Bowl. Kalen DeBoer started his Iron Bowl Rivalry with a win, making him the 4th Alabama head coach to win their first meeting with Auburn. The last to do it was Dennis Franchione in 2001, defeating the then ranked #17 Auburn Tigers 31-7 at Jordan-Hare Stadium. Alabama currently sits in the 11th spot in the penultimate College Football Playoff Rankings. Their fate likely lands with the SMU Mustangs as they take on the Clemson Tigers in the ACC Championship game, Saturday at 8pm ET. Below I have depth/injury updates, an Iron Bowl review, and College Football Playoff scenarios. Let’s go!

 

## Depth/Injury Notes:

·        Alabama rotated Right Guards Jaedon Roberts and Geno VanDeMark

·        Bama rotated Right Tackles Elijah Pritchett and Wilkin Formby

·        Kobe Prentice did not play on Offense and is expected to enter the NCAA transfer portal

·        Redshirt Freshman Jahlil Hurley plans to enter the transfer portal with 3 years of eligibility left

·        Justin Jefferson started at middle linebacker and took over the green-dot helmet communications on the Defensive side of the ball, due to Deontae Lawson’s injury

 

## Iron Bowl Review: Auburn Tigers

**Offense:** Alabama’s Offense gained 457 yards of total offense against Auburn, scoring 4 touchdowns in the contest. Jalen led the team in passing and rushing, combining for 360 total yards and 3 touchdowns. Germie Bernard was the leading receiver catching 7 passes for 111 yards. Germie has quickly become the go-to guy for Jalen, as he constantly finds open grass in front of him. His role is similar to that of John Metchie in 2021 who Bryce Young looked to often when they needed a big play. As Germie grows, he has the potential to be a 1,000-yard receiver next season. Jam and Justice struggled running the ball, averaging only 3 yards per carry. The lack of a traditional run game led to Nick Sheridan switching out the right guards and tackles during the contest. While the offense as a whole was successful against Auburn, there were far too many turnovers. Jalen threw an interception and fumbled twice, losing one of them. Ryan Williams fumbled during Alabama’s opening drive as they entered Auburn’s side of the field. If Alabama gets into the playoff, ball security will be vital.

**Defense:** Alabama’s Defense played well, holding Auburn to 14 points on the day. Jihaad Campbell led the team in tackles and Tim Keenan recorded the only sack on the day. The defense had to stand tall as Bama’s offense turned the ball over 3 times. Bray Hubbard and Zabien Brown both recorded interceptions, cutting into the turnover deficit. Bray Hubbard has been exceptional since taking over at Safety after Keon Sabb was injured. The defense has played well to close out the year. They are Playoff-Ready if Alabama is selected.

**Special Teams:** Graham Nicholson made all 4 PATs and did not attempt a field goal. James Burnip had an average day, punting 3 times with an average of 42 yards per attempt. Ryan Williams attempted one punt return for 8 yards. Kendrick Law averaged 19 yards per kickoff return.

 

## College Football Playoff Scenarios:

Alabama currently sits ranked #11 in the College Football Playoff Rankings. If the playoff started today, they would be traveling to South Bend, Indiana to take on the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. Alabama is 0-2 All-Time against the Irish at South Bend. The general media perception is that regardless of Championship outcomes, Alabama will travel to South Bend to take on the Irish. When asked if SMU could fall below Alabama after a loss, CFP Chairman Warde Manuel said “Potentially, yes”. Nothing is set in stone, but Alabama remains hopeful.

The key game on Saturday to determine Alabama’s Playoff Chances is the ACC Championship between the Clemson Tigers and SMU Mustangs. SMU is currently a 2.5-point favorite over Clemson. This is SMU’s first year in the ACC, as they take on Clemson who has won 7 of the last 9 ACC Championship games. SMU is ranked #8 and would hold a BYE as the 3 seed if they win. The 4 Byes are awarded to the 3 highest ranked Conference Champions. If Clemson were to win, they would likely take the 4th seed (BYE). It will be interesting to see what the committed does with SMU should they lose. They are ranked #8, so we would expect them to remain in the top 11. However, the committee could drop them below Alabama, keeping the Tide in the 11th spot.

Another Conference Championship to monitor is Boise State vs UNLV in the Mountain West. Should Boise State lose, similarly UNLV would be awarded a playoff spot, but would the committee drop Boise below Alabama? Boise State is 11-1, but 0-1 against top-25 teams. This would put them at 0-2 in such games, likely dropping them out of the top-12. Alabama is not in the driver’s seat, however being ranked ahead of Miami, Ole Miss, and South Carolina means that they will get the last spot, should it be available.

Early Signing Day ends today, December 6th. I will send out a signing day special early next week.
