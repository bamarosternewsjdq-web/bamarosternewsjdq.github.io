## Hello and Roll Tide!

Spring Practice kicked off last week and between the freshman class and incoming transfers, there are a lot of new faces. New Offensive Coordinator Ryan Grubb has plenty to work with going into this season. Let's meet the 2025 Freshmen on the offensive side of the ball:

·        **QB Keelan Russell (#12)** – Keelon went to Duncanville High School in Duncanville, Texas where he passed for 4,177 yards with 55 touchdowns in his senior season, winning National Gatorade Player of the year award. Keelon is officially the highest rated Alabama recruit ever, passing Bryce Young with a composite score of 0.9997. Many scouts compare Keelon to Jayden Daniels as he is both a gifted runner and accurate passer. We should expect Keelon to challenge Ty Simpson for the starting job this fall.

·        **RB AK Dear (#0)** – AK went to Quitman High School in Quitman, Mississippi where he was the 4th highest rated recruit in the state. At 6-1 210lbs, Dear is bigger than recent running back recruits at Alabama. He is similar to Brian Robinson when he first got to campus. Dear shows great patience, with the ability to bull-run up the middle. He was a 100-meter track runner in high school, giving him great explosiveness should a running lane open up. Dear is very similar to Richard Young, so we should expect Dear to be in a reserve role this season.

·        **WR Derek Meadows (#30)** – Meadows attended national powerhouse Bishop Gorman where he played at the Varsity level all 4 years. 247 has him listed at 6-5 208lbs with an 80” wingspan. Meadows won the Nevada 2023 Gatorade Track and Field Player of the Year as he won state in the 300m hurdles and took 2nd in the 110m hurdles. His size, speed, and raw athleticism could make Meadows a nightmare matchup for smaller defensive backs. He could see playing time right away in red zone situations.

·        **WR Lotzeir Brooks (#17)** – Brooks attended Millville High School in Millville, New Jersey where he set the state records for career receiving yards (4,615), receptions (223), and touchdowns (67). At 5-9 188lbs, he’s a bit undersized but makes up for that with pure speed. Brooks will be wearing #17, following two speedsters Jalen Waddle and Isaiah Bond. Brooks will surely need to put on some weight before getting reps at wide receiver, but we may see him involved on Special Teams this season. His speed in the open field could be game-changing.

·        **TE Kaleb Edwards (no number yet)** – Kaleb is a big tight end (6-6 255lbs) from El Dorado Hills, California. Edwards played Varsity Football and Basketball at Oak Ridge. His basketball skills can be seen on the football field as Kaleb excels in 50/50 jump-ball situations. At his size, he is also an established blocker. Tight ends typically need time to develop, so we may not see Edwards play this season other than special teams.

·        **TE Marshall Pritchett (#18)** – Pritchett played varsity ball at Rabun Gap-Nacoochee High School in Georgia. Marshall started his career at Quarterback before moving to wide receiver. As he filled out his 6-5 frame, Pritchett eventually moved to Tight End. His experience at quarterback makes him a high IQ receiver who can often take advantage of zone-coverage. Pritchett will need to develop as a blocker before seeing any meaningful time at Alabama.

·        **OL Michael Carroll (#64)** – Carroll played varsity football at National Powerhouse IMG Academy. He enters Alabama with a similar frame as IMG alumni Tyler Booker. At 6-6 315lbs, Michael could make an impact with Alabama immediately. Carroll should compete for Booker’s vacant left guard position. Scouts labeled Carroll as a can’t-miss prospect, so we should expect to see him start sooner than later.

·        **OL Jackson Lloyd (#57)** – Lloyd stands at a massive 6-7 315lbs and can play either left or right tackle. He has the perfect frame to be a Power-4 starter. He was a three sport athlete, notably a very athletic basketball forward, helping his quickness. Playing 3 sports did not allow him to take advantage of the off-season strength program. Lloyd will need to get stronger before we see him competing for snaps at Alabama.

·        **OL Micah DeBose (#65)** – Standing at 6-5 325lbs, DeBose is the heaviest offensive lineman in this year’s class. Projected as an inside lineman, Micah has experience playing the tackle position. DeBose played basketball and threw shot put, displaying both athleticism and strength. Depending on need, Micah will likely try out multiple positions along the line.

·        **OL Mal Waldrep (#52)** – Mal is an instate prospect who attended Central High School in Phenix City. Waldrep primarily played left tackle for this 7A program, but at 322lbs he could easily slide into the guard position or center. On3 has him listed as IOL while 247 lists him as an OT.


Look out for the next additions previewing the Defensive Freshmen as well as the 2025 transfers.


Roll Tide!
