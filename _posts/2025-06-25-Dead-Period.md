## Hello and Roll Tide! 

After 4 weeks of official visits, the NCAA Football Dead Period began at midnight on June 23rd. During the Dead Period, coaches cannot talk to recruits or their families in person until July 31st. With the Dead Period approaching, Alabama hosted 15 recruits on official visits over the weekend. This group consisted of three recruits who had already committed to Alabama (Zyan Gibson, Jett Thomalla, and Chris Booker) as well as other big names planning to announce their commitments soon. Two recruits committed very soon after their official visits (Rihyael Kelley and Javari Barnett). Alabama’s 2026 class is ranked 33rd Nationally but they are in the mix for many remaining top prospects. In-state targets Cederian Morgan, Anthony Jones, and Ezavier Crowell could shoot Alabama up the rankings. Alabama also remains in contention for 5-stars Xavier Griffin and Jireh Edwards, from Georgia and Maryland respectively. Below is a summary of the 2026 recruiting class so far and a list of upcoming announcements to look out for:
